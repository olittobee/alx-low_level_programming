## What are files in C? ##
A file is used to store huge data. C provides multiple file management functions like file creation, opening and reading files, Writing to the file, and closing a file. The file is used to store relevant data and file handling in C is used to manipulate the data.

## Types of Files in C ##
There are mainly two types of files that can be handled using File Handling in C as mentioned below:

- Text Files
- Binary Files

1. Text Files
 These are simple text files that are saved by the (.txt) extension and can be created or modified by any text editor. Text file stores data in the form of ASCII characters and is used to store a stream of characters.

 2. Binary Files
 It is stored in binary format instead of ASCII characters. Binary files are normally used to store numeric Information (int, float, double). Here data is stored in binary form i.e, (0’s and 1’s).

 C Files Operations
C Files can perform multiple useful operations that are mentioned below:

Creation of a new file (fopen with attributes as “a” or “a+” or “w” or “w+”).
Opening an existing file (fopenopen).
Reading from file (fscanf or fgets).
Writing to a file with fprintf or fputs.
Moving file pointer associated with a given file to a specific position. (fseek, rewind).
Closing a file (close).
