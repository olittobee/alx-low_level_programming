Singly linked lists in C are a type of data structure that can be used to store and organize data. They consist of nodes, which contain the actual data as well as a pointer to the next node in the list. This makes it possible for each node to point at another one, creating an ordered sequence. The main advantage of singly linked lists is their flexibility; they allow for easy insertion and deletion since only one link needs to be changed when adding or removing elements from the list. Additionally, they require less memory than other types of linear structures like arrays or stacks because there is no need for extra space between items on the list – just a single link pointing from one item to its successor (or predecessor). 

A basic implementation of singly-linked lists requires two core components: A head node containing information about where in memory should start looking through all other nodes; and individual “node” objects with two fields - “data” field that holds whatever information you want stored inside your list and “next_ptr” - which points towards either nothing (in case this element was last) or some address where another object resides (which will become our current element if we were iterating through such SLL). Furthermore, functions must also be implemented so users can add new elements into specific positions within their SLLs; delete existing ones out from them etc... 
    			  

Finally, there are many advantages associated with using singly-linked lists over more traditional array based solutions: first off all insertions/deletions take constant time regardless how big our collection already is whereas arrays would require us reallocating bigger chunks every time new item comes along – something not always desirable especially if dealing with large amounts thereof! Secondly due lack references between different parts our code becomes much easier read by humans since everything looks cleaner without unnecessary connections everywhere allowing us focus solely on what really matters most — logic behind certain operations rather then having spend additional effort trying comprehending whole picture at once!
