## 0x12. C - Singly linked lists ##

A singly linked list is a type of data structure in C programming that consists of nodes connected by pointers. Each node contains two pieces of information: a value and the address or pointer to the next node in the list. The first item, called the head, points to null if there are no other items; otherwise it points to another node which holds its own value and pointer. The last item has its pointer set as NULL indicating that it is at the end of this particular sequence.
